# React Babel Webpack Boilerplate

This is an as simple as possible ES6/Webpack boilerplate for getting up and running with React. The purpose of this is for quickly prototyping with all the goodness of the NPM system at your disposal. Also include go server for extra battery power.

## Setup Guide

Webpack is now watching your project for changes and a Go server is running.
